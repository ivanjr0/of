# Python Import Rules
- Always place all imports at the top of the file
- No imports inside functions or methods
- Use absolute imports for internal code (e.g., `from app.services import something` instead of `from services import something`)
- Group imports in the following order:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party imports
  3. Local application imports
- Separate each group with a blank line
